### **Design Requirements:**  
1. **Maintain Existing Color Palette:**  
   - Primary colors: Blues (`#007BFF`, `#2c3e50`), reds (`#e74c3c`), and gradients (e.g., `linear-gradient(135deg, #f5f7fa 0%, #c3cfe2 10%)`).  
   - Accent colors (e.g., `#3498db`, `#1a1a2e`) should remain consistent.  

2. **Enhance Professionalism:**  
   - **Typography:** Improve font hierarchy (e.g., use a modern sans-serif like "Inter" or "Poppins") with better contrast and readability.  
   - **Spacing:** Increase padding/margins for sections (e.g., `about`, `education`) to reduce clutter.  
   - **Consistency:** Ensure uniform styling for buttons, cards, and headings (e.g., rounded corners, shadow effects).  

3. **Visual Appeal:**  
   - **Hero Section:** Refine the gradient overlay on the background image for better text legibility.  
   - **Project Cards:** Add hover animations (e.g., scale transform, subtle shadow elevation).  
   - **Interests Grid:** Improve background image blending (e.g., darker overlays for text contrast).  

4. **Interactive Elements:**  
   - Smooth transitions for navigation links and buttons.  
   - Animate the programming languages ticker to loop seamlessly.  
   - Add a loading spinner for the contact form submission.  

5. **Responsiveness:**  
   - Optimize grid layouts (e.g., `interests-grid`) for mobile (`1fr`) and tablet (`2fr`).  
   - Ensure the hamburger menu is intuitive and accessible.  

6. **Micro-Interactions:**  
   - Hover effects for social media icons (e.g., color shift, bounce).  
   - Subtle parallax scrolling for the hero section.

### **Deliverables:**  
1. **HTML/CSS Code:**  
   - Clean, commented, and semantically structured.  
   - Use CSS variables for color consistency.  

2. **Optional Enhancements:**  
   - Dark mode toggle (using existing colors).  
   - Scroll-triggered animations (e.g., fade-in sections).  

**Note:** Preserve all existing content (text, images, links) while elevating the designâ€™s sophistication. Prioritize accessibility (WCAG compliance) and cross-browser compatibility.
